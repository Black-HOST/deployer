        with:
          server: ${{ secrets.FTP_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.FTP_USER }}
          password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASS }}

This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. While it has been tested extensively, you should use it at your own risk.

Be especially cautious when using the `delete: true` option, as it will permanently remove files from your remote server that do not exist in your local directory. If you don't feel confident, always perform a dry_run: true first to verify which files will be deleted.
